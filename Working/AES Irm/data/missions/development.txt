			`The spaceport is as busy as ever, swarming with work crew rushing to refuel your ship as you leave it. Despite being the reason this port found Human habitation in the first place, you can't help but feel out of place, you spend nowhere near as much time here as David or his advisors.`
			`	Recalling that his advisors were reassigned to research and development, you could offer them your help.`
			choice
				`	(Leave.)`

				`	(Visit the development department.)`
			`	You enter the room you were shown when it was empty, it is no longer so quiet. The room is unexpectedly abuzz with the chatter of several groups of men and women spread throughout. Markerboards that have seen heavy use lay between these groups scrawled with innumerable calculations, you couldn't possibly form any guess on what they're trying to prove or understand.`
			`	Anxiously, you approach a vaguely familiar advisor who is the only person in this room you recognize. "I wasn't expecting a visitor, do you need something?" she says, recognizing you in turn but expectedly irreverent. You offer your help to their efforts, in whichever way you can, you're not even sure how. She fiddles with her tablet, and talks to one of her staff, before getting back to you. "Not in here. You wouldn't enjoy it any more than I do but, we do have some testing equipment on order. Big, bulky, freighter-worthy."`
			choice
				`	"Courier work?"`
					goto "work"
				`	"How big are we talking?"`
			`	"Big enough that I don't want a non-descript company worker to handle the shipping. You're competent enough for David to trust you as a partner, and you're lending a hand. I should count myself lucky that I might have more than a drone to work with, might."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you?"`
				`	"What's the job?"`
			label "work"
			`	She looks directly into your eyes, head still hunched towards her tablet, "We need to carry out simultaneous testing of one article of alien equipment we've dug up and our best replication of it." Narrowing her eyes back onto her tablet but unmoving, she continues, "Much to our frustration, we cannot accurately mirror their designs, and we need more precise and emulatory equipment than we have on hand to know the capabilities of both theirs and ours."`
			`	"David wants to know the feasibility of each piece of technology in a ship environment, so these tests won't even be completely useful for our purposes." She furrows her brow and pinches the ridge of her nose, vividly showing her frustration with the job.`
			choice
				`	(Accept the courier job.)`
					goto "courier"
				`	"What tests do you really have to do?"`
			`	Looking up at you, somewhat surprised you're still wanting to know more. You're unsure if you're being a nuisance but she obliges you, "Well we ultimately need practical experience, ship-bound operation measures."`
			`	"The cooling systems we want to test would need to be under a long exposure of hotter than usual operation, so that means long expeditions relying on the yet-untested systems. Everything David wants points to a ship-centric selection of outfits."`
			choice
				`	"I can test the new cooling systems on my ship."`
				`	(Accept the courier job.)`
					goto "courier"
			`	Hesitant, she responds to your offer, "I'll need to be on board to observe the systems function. It'd be a long expedition, up to a month, to the south of Human space and back again."`
			`	Hushed, she whispers to you, "Have you truly traveled beyond Human and Hai space?"`
			choice
				`	"I have."`
				`	"I don't know what you're talking about"`
					goto "dont know"
			`	"I wonder if you'll share with me what lies beyond, some time." she says with an inquisitive awe.`
				goto "expedition"
			label "dont know"
			`	"That's a shame, David sometimes mentions your exploits and rumors he's heard. Spinning tales as he does I suppose." she says, obviously suspicious of your feigned ignorance.`
				goto "expedition"
			label "courier"
			`	She hurridly checks with those around her, surprised to find out that the equipment has already been arranged to be picked up and is on its way to be delivered back here. "I'm sorry Captain, the job is already underway."`
			`	"Perhaps you could be the pilot for the ship-bound trial after these tests if you're interested?"`

			`	You make your travel arrangements with Cassipeau, that's the advisor's name as revealed during some continued conversation. The replicated cooling system gets installed onto your ship, ready to be tested.`
			`	"So the plan is to travel south, stopover on Zug in the Free Worlds, and make our way back here." she reiterates to you once aboard your ship.`
			`	After a hesitant pause, she then offers, "Unless you wanted to show me something special."`

			`	It seems she is open to you making the travel plans. You can travel to Zug as originally planned, but the background temperature of the Ember Wastes may be a more effective test for the cooling systems capability.`

Not only did we get the data we need, which looks very promising by the way, but I also didn't realize how much I'd needed to get off-world." she says, seemingly renewed from the tense exterior she had the day you initiated this journey.`
