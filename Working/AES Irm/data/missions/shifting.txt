			`On arrival to the abandoned station, you decide to explore the structure, perhaps there's something that points to whoever built this, whenever it was built. Several halls stretch far, the contents plucked clean but there are entryways along the walls. They lead nowhere obvious as most are just a tube-like space, something resembling an elevator.`
			`	It just seems to offer more of the same barren rooms anywhere you go, only defaced surfaces vaunting what you assume to be the work of passing pirate lords. You decide to return to your ship as there doesn't seem to be anything of substance left here.`
			`	Something you didn't notice before in the hum of your ship during landing, there's a faint thrum echoing from within your ship through the dock. You follow the sound until you reach where it is loudest, evidently, it's emanating from your Quantum Keystone, which is glowing a faint yellow and vibrating softly.`
			`	Out of an underlying fear that this situation might escalate, you quickly depart the station, hoping that it's nothing of consequence.`

			`You're walking through the bustling docks of the port, with ships arriving and departing non-stop, Remnant ports sure seem to be some of the busiest you find yourself at. Not long after finding yourself in the spaceport of <planet>, you're approached by what you assume to be security personnel.`
			`	"Hello captain, is the '<ship>' your ship?" they ask you in a rather friendly manner, and you confirm that it is, "We've been asked to fetch you to meet one of the technicians in the outfitters."`
			`	You're led by security to the outfitters and greeted promptly by a Remnant with comically large tinted goggles. Your escorts stop and tell the man; "Here is the Captain of the <ship>, We'll leave them in your hands now." before walking away from you two.`
			`	"I'll make this quick, you're not in trouble. On your arrival, we noticed an abnormality in your Keystone that I believe I can help you with. We occasionally run into a similar problem during the 'Ion Storms' we encounter in the region, we have augmentations to encompass the Keystone that remove unsafe levels of resonant build-up and I have to insist that we install it for you."`

				`	"What happens at 'unsafe levels'?"`
			`	"Unsafe as in it won't allow you to travel through our wormholes anymore. Nothing so harmful as to directly compromise your safety, but it's a problem you don't want to be on the wrong side of."`
			`	With that explanation, you allow for the rather speedy installation of the device, and you're eager to be left to your devices.`
