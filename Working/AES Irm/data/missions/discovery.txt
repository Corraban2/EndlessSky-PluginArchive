			`Touching down within one of Alta Hais hangers is second in ease only to an outdoor landing pad. You stand still once outside your ship, hanging on the sight of the massive hanger stretching into the distance but shake the feeling before long.`
			`	One of the Quarg of a small group standing beside the doorway out of the hanger breaks off from their discussion to speak to you, "Hello merchant, your ship is auraed, I can see it."`
			choice
				`	"What are you talking about?"`
				`	"I don't see anything wrong with my ship."`
			`	"Your ship has been touched by the Irm, it stays with you. Do you have a Quantum Keystone with your ship?" they 'elaborate', unhelpfully. You answer in turn, "The '<ship>' has a Quantum Keystone, but so do most of the Hai who board here."`
			`	They blink slowly, ruminating on their thoughts, "But they do not touch the Irm, the station of Waypoint is troublesome to the crystals."`
			choice
				`	"Why don't they get rid of it?"`
				`	"Are you saying that station damaged my ship?"`
					goto "damage"
				`	"What is the 'Irm'?"`
					goto "irm"
			`	"The Hai cannot rid Waypoint of the Irm, for what they don't understand, remains present." The answer is as worrisome as it is vague, so you try to disregard it as best you can.`
			`	You shift topics back to the crystal, "What does the station do to the crystal?"`
			label "damage"
			`	"They can alter the crystal, collect charge. No harm should come to you, but the Hai rumor that the station reverses the good luck from the crystals." The Quarg describes, gradually telling more sensible tales.`
			choice
				`	"What really happens to the crystals?"`
				`	"Do I need to worry?"`
			`	The naturally slow to reply Quarg lends many moments of thought to you, the dragging discussion feels anything but productive. "The crystals very rarely interfere with spacial phenomena, there is negligible concern. The Hai are wrong about the 'good luck' effects of the crystals but the tales they tell are charming." The Quarg retreats to some seating along the walls, and you decide to follow them.`
			`	"You mentioned the 'Irm'? What is that?" you ask.`
			label "irm"
			`	"They are highly advanced people, with a deep-held belief in the supremacy of progress. They lived in designed habitats on the surface of their world, and eventually, time demanded them to rise above to live aboard a ringworld of their making. Irm created a harmonious work of nature and technology, challenged by none but our living example."`
			`	"Irm mastered the art of self-suffice, using automated machinery to meet their needs under a prologist's watch, which itself was automated. They harnessed the power of their star, positioning energy collectors to ensure the utilization of their star's lights. Their ultimate means fostered a culture rich with continuous learning and innovation."`
			`	Mysteriously, little recognition is afforded to your questions about where the ring is in space now. The subject of the complete and strangely untraceable disappearance of the Irm is avoided, so you decide not to press these questions considering how fortunate you are to get this retelling as it is.`

			`You depart the station to a truly remarkable sight, a completed ringworld with massive circadian shaders on a tighter orbit with the star. You have no frame of reference to how long these structures have been left here, you have to carefully decide whether to enquire about what you've found to anyone.`
			`	The Quarg may be able to help, though you stumbled here largely by accident, and it wasn't exactly a straight-forward journey. The Quarg might go as far as to impede the way of entry.`
