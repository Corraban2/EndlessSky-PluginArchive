	description `This localized cooling system is tailored for immediate need equipment and is incredibly useful as it helps maintain ideal operating temperatures, this often prevents overheating and potential damage. By targeting cooling regionally aboard a ship, it ensures efficient heat dissipation and potentially avoids thermal shut-down.`

	description `The optimal temperature for habitation is innately made difficult in space, as it's difficult to shed excess heat. On-demand cooling is a popular choice so as to maintain temperatures at a comfortable level and offset periods of temperature-induced stress.`
	description `The thermal mass provided by this equipment is much like a temperature buffer, absorbing and storing excess heat during spikes in operating temperature. It helps to stabilize the operating environment by releasing stored heat when cooled down, preventing sudden fluctuations.`

	description `The geometry and subsequent workings of this technology seem incomprehensible to any user. However, surprisingly, it proves more than a match for any set of engines of a similar size, especially any that allows for fully-fledged maneuverability. Tekina engines boast a very conservative drain on a ship's resources, far outshining the efficiency of many engines available in this size.`
