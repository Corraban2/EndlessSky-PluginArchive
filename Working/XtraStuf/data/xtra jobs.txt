			`You find James in the spaceport bar, talking with a woman wearing a business suit. The expression on James' face is growing increasingly concerned as she speaks. Seeing you come in, he waves to you and you join them at the table.`
			`	"Hello <first>," says James. "This is Marissa, a senior manager at the mines." You shake hands with her.`
			`	"Here's the deal," says Marissa. "Most of the gemstones we mine here are industrial grade, not pretty enough to be worth using as anything but sandpaper grit or drill bits. But every once in a while we happen on some higher quality gems. No one in this sector has the money to spend on jewelry, so we ship them north to the Paradise Worlds.`
			`	"But in the past few months, every shipment we've sent has been attacked by a pirate ship, the Hammer of Thor. We don't have the money to pay a bounty hunter to take out the Hammer, so instead we're going to pay you to outrun it. Is the <ship> a fast ship?"`
			choice
				`	"As fast as they come. Nothing bigger than a fighter could chase it down."`
				`	"Not fast enough. I don't think I can risk taking on this mission."`
					decline
			`	"Great," she says. "My people will load up your ship immediately. Good luck, Captain."`
			`	After she leaves, James says to you, "Now, get one thing clear. This is not your David and Goliath moment. The Hammer's shields are ten times as strong as yours, and if it's able to bring its weapons to bear, we'll be dead in two seconds. So, the moment we're in the sky, we head straight for hyperspace. Don't even wait around to see if the Hammer is coming or not. Got it?"`
			choice
				`	"Got it."`
					accept
				`	"I really shouldn't try to fight?"`
			`	"It just isn't feasible," he says. "If a ship has turrets, your Sparrow can't get close enough to hit it with your guns without being damaged, and then it's just a matter of whose weapons and shields are stronger. And one heavy rocket hit could nearly disable you. Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances, or at least not with weapons that can fit in a Sparrow. So, don't risk it. It's like rock paper scissors; recognize what your enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, as well as your own."`

			`As you land on Ingot, James says, "Well, you made it in one piece! Still think you want to be piloting a Sparrow?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure, but I can't wait until I've got a ship big enough to stand up to pirates instead of running from them."`
				`	"Well, maybe I should've bought a freighter instead."`
			`	"Better start saving up then," he says. "I know a number of old Sparrow pilots who made their first million credits mining asteroids before they could afford a more combat-worthy ship. They had to look around for a while before finding a system with any asteroids worth mining, but it was worth it. Anyway, let's go get your payment." You walk out of the ship and sign the papers to hand off the <commodity> to the dock workers on <planet>. They hand you a credit chip worth <payment>.`
			`	"If you're willing to take me on one more journey," says James, "meet me in the spaceport bar in a little while."`
