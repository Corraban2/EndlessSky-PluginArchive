---Notice---
Thank you for installing Endless Sky: Republic Rising. I am open to any suggestoins about fixes, improvements or new content. Republic Rising is only available on ModDB so I advise against downloading from other websites. 

---Installation---
Unpack contents to your Endless Sky directory.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Sky

If you are installing a patch or newer version all files in the plugins folder must be overwritten with the newest patch.

All outdated versions of the ships will not update, you must sell all the old ships and buy the new version from the Spaceport!

The next time Endless Sky is launched, the modification should already be loaded. If you cannot find any Republic Rising content, please notify me and I will try to fix the problem.
