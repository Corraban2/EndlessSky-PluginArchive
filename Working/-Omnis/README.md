### Welcome to Omnis!
Omnis has risen to be the #1 all-content plugin in the community, though competition is still encouraged as only from different perspectives can the best iteration of this niche be reached. Omnis was released after [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge) but before [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo), and good faith was practiced by all competing authors.

In order of release, known competitors have been:
- [All Content Plugin](https://github.com/endless-sky/all-content-plugin)
- [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge)
- [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo)

### What to expect
There is no need to worry about breaking existing saves when installing, it only adds a developer area to the map that doesn't affect regular gameplay in any way.

So how do you use this plugin? Well there are two very simple methods of [accessing Omnis](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/-Omnis/wiki/Access), there is a wormhole in Rutilicus to travel there, and there is a custom start that can be chosen when making a new pilot.

> [!WARNING]
> The Omnis custom start will begin your pilot with an impossibly high credit value and brand your save with the Omnis start.
