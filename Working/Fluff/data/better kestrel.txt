			`Within the spaceport bar, you are approached by a familiar face. Charles Atinoda excitedly fawns over some of your famous exploits and wastes no time in revealing what he wants from you.`
			`	"Captain <last>, I'm sure you remember helping us test our latest ship release." Charles leaves open, "I do." you say.`
			`	Charles stands straight and says, "The Tarazed Corporation has had great success following the release of the Kestrel, and I'm very excited to offer you an exclusive partnership that you alone qualify for."`
			`	"You don't want me to fight another ship do you?" you ask.`
			`	"Not quite so confrontational, we would like to sell you a prototype of the Kestrel far surpassing the design sold to the masses. It will require a large investment on your part but you will earn a substantial stipend for as long as you personally pilot it, we want to use your influence to get the Kestrel into the hands of our customers." This is a big decision, but you can't help but picture yourself at command of a ship unparalleled.`
			`	Charles leaves a brief moment for you to ruminate on the pitch, before continuing, "Now, in numbers your investment would be in the order of 140 million credits, your stipend would be 28 thousand credits daily."`
			`	"This prototype is constructed using proprietary materials and technology not yet found in the consumer market. I'll be leaving for Tarazed headquarters now, follow me and we'll sort the contract, and the ship will be yours." He hangs on your decision`
