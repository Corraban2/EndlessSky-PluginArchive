	description `Eerily, there are no winged creatures amongst the skies and few land-roaming animals. Those animals that do walk the land however are large, lumbering beasts that easily dwarf small buildings. The most dominant species noticeably resemble old earth humans, they boast the build of a typical human and travel in groups when in the wilderness`
	description `The human-like aliens appear to hold defensive technologies far beyond what their meager villages would imply. Metal towers rise from the areas most developed which your scans detect as emitting shields to protect settlements from assault. The various towns and villages that scatter the land appear to be interconnected by rows of planted flora surrounding long roadways that allow access between settlements.`
	spaceport `The spaceport can be any of dozens of areas you find on the outskirts of a massive city stretching beyond your sight, they are multiple-story complexes with one very large landing pad along the rooftop of each building. The city as seen on the descent is a sprawling urban hive of vessels whizzing past at near-miss distances from one another. The buildings you see below, even on the edge of the city, are tall and brutalist in form.`
	spaceport `The center of the city is marked by an unbelievably tall spire, of shining black metal in a carved exterior that demands attention from every angle, adorned by the feat of a space elevator. The height of the buildings rises as they get more distant from the spire, a glaring dissimilarity from human city architecture.`
planet "Pesek"
	description `A lifeless rock with little in the way of a breathable atmosphere, and no immediate signs of any past civilization. The barren landscape is sparsely spotted by sky-scraping stone spires of almost artisan curves and angles. The planet's mostly empty, flat landscape is suitable for landing any number of ships.`
