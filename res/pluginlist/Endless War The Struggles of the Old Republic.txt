description=I've been slowly working on a Star Wars mod set at the beginning of the Great Galactic War between the New Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, some four thousand years before the battle of Yavin. Right now it is far from complete, though I do have jobs and many factions implement, as well as over 40 complete star systems.
